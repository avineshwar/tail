# tail
## a C-based tool to extract specified number of end lines from a stream of text.

### Compile using "cc main.c -o tail -Wall"

### Sample usage 1: "dmesg | tail"
### Sample usage 2: "dmesg | tail -n", such that n is a positive integer.



###### The idea has been taken from an already similar (nearby perfect) tool in existence named "tail" found in Linuces, BSDs and Unices, for the sole purpose of practise, however, I believe I am going to extend it to compile several tools into one by contradicting the Linux philosophy of "Do one thing, and do it good".
It might be "If you want to do more than one thing, do it even better".
